# OpenAI Chat Bot

See [bot/README.md](./bot/README.md) for instructions on running the Google Chat bot or integrating with the GitHub MCP server.

You could also try the [ChatGPT Teams Bot app](https://github.com/formulahendry/chatgpt-teams-bot) which uses latest `gpt-3.5-turbo` model. `Turbo` is the same model family that powers ChatGPT.
